    title: "I Miss Redding",
    body: `I Miss Redding.

I miss that strange intersection with a steep incline cutting back from East Street to Pine when you‚Äôre craving some good coffee & better chats at Evergreen.

For no particular reason, I miss that section of the Sacramento River Trail near the Arboretum where the raised trail runs along a parking lot.

I miss the start of highway 44 East out of downtown, sloping over the river and inviting you to take advantage of what feels like a premature 65 mph speed limit.

I miss Dana Drive & Minder Park.

I miss Norman Drive & Lema Ranch.

I miss Dogwood Lane... Kind of üòâ

I miss setting up for worship sets, somehow a beautiful combination of skill, practical preparation, team connection, and Spiritual tuning up. I miss being trusted with the privilege of stewarding a room in musical worship, doing my best to utterly thrill a triune God while building a gateway between heaven & earth, attempting to somehow thin the perceived separation.

I miss those spontaneous drives to Whiskeytown that provided fairly epic vistas... But were sometimes more just excuses to talk.

I miss Sunday mornings at College View, stepping into the auditorium I used to only see on YouTube videos, and scanning the crowd for so many faces I‚Äôve grown to love.

I miss Trader Joes & WinCo.

I miss Theory Coffee.

I miss in first year when my roommate would talk, almost with awe, about some wild man named Chuck Parry whose book he had read that had seen tons of incredible healings & miracles. And I miss Third Year when I got to be one of the six students to comprise Chuck‚Äôs team for the year.

I miss those early Saturday mornings, setting up for another couple hundred guests to the healing rooms, and praying that none would leave without a fresh encounter with Jesus.

I miss Chamise Peak & Shasta Dam.

I miss Dann Farrely and his ‚ÄúNerd Excursions.‚Äù I miss Rich Schmidt routinely blowing my mind as he unpacked the Bible like I‚Äôd never experienced. I miss Bill Johnson, and those sermons that were less like 5-point, structured teaching sessions, and more like wanderings through his personal devotions that somehow left you stirred, provoked, and encouraged more deeply than any detailed note taking could capture. I miss Kris Vallotton, with his sometimes brutally honest way of communicating and hilarious vulnerability while sharing victorious lessons that were hard won.

I miss too many friends to list here, but you know who you are. I miss the games, the movies, the worship jam sessions, and the conversations. Oh, those conversations...

I miss that seemingly constant stream of talks with nearly everyone around me about revelations, encounters, challenges, dreams. But ultimately about one thing:

Jesus.

I deeply, truly, thoroughly miss Redding, California, and all it means to me.

Since leaving Redding, I find myself having random moments when a particular moment, person, or place in or around Redding will suddenly flash through my mind, reminding me yet again just how much that place became home. I think I underestimated just how attached I became to that city.

I‚Äôm still grappling with exactly what to do when those memories come flooding back. Mostly I just take a minute or two to thank God for the gift it was to spend three years of my life in Redding & at Bethel. I‚Äôm not sure exactly what else to to do.

I‚Äôm certainly not planning on moving back; that‚Äôs not what this post is about. It‚Äôs not even about a longing to go back. In many ways, going back geographically wouldn‚Äôt really accomplish that much. Sure, visiting Redding would bring about some great nostalgia, and getting to hang out at Bethel is always a delight. Plus, I do still have incredible friends living there that would be lovely to see again. I‚Äôm certain Kendra & I will venture down there sometime in the future.

But I can‚Äôt step back into those memories. They were moments, incredible ones, but not ones that could or even should be repeated. But these flashback moments have me musing.



Perhaps it‚Äôs just being back in Canada and Ontario for the first autumn in years, but this past fall season astounded me with brilliant colours like I can‚Äôt remember happening before ‚Äî except for that one October in Algonquin Park ‚Äî and it‚Äôs made me think a lot about seasons in general. In particular, the reaction to the changing: while most trees burst with orange, yellow, and red around the same time, there are always outliers.

Some, seemingly eager to be rid of the previous season, shed their leaves early, and stand stark & stale, ready to embrace winter while trees around them continue to glory in the brilliance of fall.

Others, on the other hand, seem to cling to summer, awkwardly hanging on to bunches of green leaves, as if in denial of the passing of an era.

Perhaps it‚Äôs a predictable cliche, but I still like the metaphor...

I want to be one that changes gracefully. I want to embrace each season fully.

I want to celebrate what has past or is passing with honour without trying to stretch it past its heavenly ‚Äúbest before‚Äù date, but I also don‚Äôt want to speed past a season that perhaps feels hidden, painful, or otherwise uncomfortable in a desperate attempt to get to some fantasy future of recognition & ease when God‚Äôs still revelling in the wonder of the here & now, with all its pruning and stretching and growing.

I miss BSSM. But I‚Äôm not going back.

I‚Äôm eager to see what God has in store for us in the future. But I refuse to let the future compromise my focus on the present.

Jesus, thank you for the here & now. Let the growth of the previous season flood me with gratitude, the promise of all that is to come pervade me with hope, and the beauty of the present fill me with wonder and attentiveness.

Let me move through every season with grace.`,
