    title: "Why I’ve moved from Cornwall",
    body: `July 13, 2023.

That’s when I first start jotting down some thoughts that I hoped would turn into a blog titled something along the lines of “Why I’m moving away from Cornwall.”

Here, some 16 months later, I try to steal a few moments here & there in the beautiful & chaotic whirl of life to collect some thoughts on the matter.

I’m confident few reading this will be at all surprised, but Cornwall, ever my home*town*, is no longer my *home*. I don’t expect it ever will be again.

Looking back farther to the summer of 2019, I posted a blog post in two parts entitled “Why I’m leaving Cornwall,” explaining the reasons I was headed — temporarily — for Redding, California, and trying to preemptively debunk some of the incorrect guesses at my motivation for doing so.

At the time, in many respects, the journey felt like leaving it all behind.

In the rear view mirror were so many things near & dear to me:

The church I had attended since its very first service in March of 2003. The worship team that had been forged in countless youth services & grew up to lead that beloved church in powerful, passionate, and excellent worship experiences. My parents, siblings, in-laws, and the growing number of nephews & nieces, whose birthday parties I had rarely missed. My job, by some reckonings the dream: stable, safe, and career-worthy.

The city I was born & raised in, and still know so well. Where I played hockey, soccer, and basketball. Where I made friends, said goodbye to some, and made more.

Those paths by the river I ran countless kilometres, had deep & worthwhile conversations, and, at times, processed out the painful & confusing moments of life with Jesus.

The beaches. The local hockey rinks. The excitement of a Starbucks coming to town, and the endless selection of Tim Hortons shops.

Those gems of people that have known my family since before I was born, and literally watched me grow up from baby to man.

Memories seemingly attached to every street & building.

Leaving something behind is never easy. It’s always painful & sad.

I suppose I felt some of those emotions when I moved to Ottawa for college, and of course, like I mentioned, when I left for my first year of ministry school. Strangely enough, those emotions felt even more forceful when I left for second year.

Then there was that beautiful transition of marriage, with all the newness & excitement & promise, but coupled with the undeniable reality of letting go as well.

Life changes. It’s in motion. Things shift.

And there’s always sadness at what gets left behind.

But for me, none of these transitions have felt quite like Kendra & I making our decision to call Aylmer — not Cornwall — home.

And not just our “home for now,” or “home for this season.” This is *home*, until we die or Jesus makes it abundantly clear He wants us elsewhere.

Until those things happen, this is where our kids will be born & grow up. Where our primary focal point for relational investment will be fixed. Where will give our energy to seeing the Kingdom expanded & the church grow.

Where we will meet people who will become lifelong friends. Where we will have passionate worship nights & life-changing conversations.

Where I will find new paths to run, discover new coffee shops, and get the opportunity to connect with Kendra’s collection of family.

Every tree requires the death of a seed. Every step of trust requires the letting go of control.

But if I’ve learned anything about God so far, it’s this:

It’ll be worth it.

I’ve never regretted trusting in God. I’ve never wished I had followed my own ideas instead of His. I’ve yet to reach the end of His Faithfulness, or scraped the bottom of His goodness.

Kendra & I haven’t moved from Cornwall because we’re trying to get away from something. We didn’t choose Aylmer because Kendra twisted my arm. We’re didn’t make this decision because we grew tired of our house there, or the church there, or the city.

Cornwall & Harvest Christian Fellowship will always be in my heart. I will always cheer on that city & church, and any chance I get I will celebrate what God is doing there. And for all of the friends & family I now get to see far less frequently than I’d like, please know my relationships with you are still the most difficult part of living so far away. I cherish every connection I made while I lived in Cornwall, and though I don’t plan on ever ending any of them, I grieve the change that must take place with the new geographical distance between.

We didn’t choose Aylmer because we were trying to leave anything.

We chose Aylmer because we simply believe God led us here.

And it still feels hard at times.

It feels hard to let go of dreams I once had that were tied to Cornwall. At times, I feel like I let people down who were assuming — like I was — that I’d someday move back and once again pour my life into that city & church. Perhaps it’s just in my mind, but I feel there are hopes & expectations of friends that I disappointed.

There’s a sadness to it. There’s a part of it that’s difficult.

And that’s okay. I didn’t say “yes” to Jesus to get an easy, carefree life.

But even if parts of this transition have felt — and still feel — hard, I’ve also felt so many gifts in our time here so far, and so much hope & expectation for the future.

I’ve felt God fill me with love for this church and the surrounding town & community.

I’ve seen God touch people in powerful ways, and heard stories of hope as people encounter Jesus afresh.

I have felt so loved, welcomed, encouraged, and supported by this entire community, and especially our lead pastors, which has made any bumps in the road feel smaller than they otherwise would.

I’ve felt such excitement as snippets of vision I have for different aspects of the church have already taken shape, and so encouraged as I see the love & care people have for each other.

And I have so much expectation for the future.

To see more people encounter Jesus, and experience everything the Kingdom is all about. To be saved, delivered, healed, and set free.

To see families strengthened, marriages restored, and men & women of God equipped to transform the world around them.

To see thriving, intimate community, where we can know & be known, and grow deep with God and each other.

To see a fresh worship movement igniting in Canada, flooding whole-hearted individuals who are focused on delighting the heart of the Father, and seeing that culture encompass the globe.

I want to see His Kingdom come, and His will be done, on earth just like it already is in heaven.

But my focus is to partner with Him to see it happen in Aylmer.

And, I suppose, *that* is why I’ve moved from Cornwall.`,

    title: "DYSFUNCTION",
    body: `Oh! Blog! Hi!

Yes, it’s me again. Finally.

If you’ve known me long enough, you may have noticed my blogging consistency has oscillated violently over the last five or six years, and dropped down to something resembling a flat line over the last year or two. And yes, a big part of that is simply a diminishing of free time, but there’s a larger blockage to my blogging flow… And it’s not that I’ve just stopped learning stuff!

No, it’s more that for whatever reason most of the ways I’ve been growing over the last while just feel more difficult to communicate effectively. Maybe they are more complicated topics, or maybe I’m getting worse at writing, but somehow when I’ve thought about sharing what Jesus has been doing in my life over the last number of months things just don’t seem to fall into place in an effective package of words.

All that to say: I’ve still been growing. Just in new ways. And in ways that, for whatever reason, have felt harder to encapsulate in a blog. 
However, over the last three months or so I feel there’ve been a few specific things Jesus has been teaching me that feel a little easier to dive into within a post, so let’s give this a go:

Recently, Jesus has been teaching me about DYSFUNCTION.

Yay.

And lest you find yourself tempted to question the presence of dysfunction in my life (I believe I have reasons to guess at that beyond arrogance), let me assure you: yes. Yes indeed, there are dysfunctions aplenty. It turns out, all those people were right when they indicated that marriage is one of the most comprehensive sanctification processes God’s come up with. In these first 22-ish months since Kendra & I got married, I have come face to face with some rather shocking things about myself. Let’s start with a quick overview of a few items, shall we?

To start with, one thing I have learned that I can sometimes get stuck in a “pout mode” that would put most two year olds to shame. And when taking the time to trace through the reasons why I feel so withdrawn and distant, it comes down to a pretty simple explanation:

I wanted my way. And I didn’t get it.

Really, self? Really? That feels rather immature.

Yep. Apparently, there’s still some selfishness inside of me that at times just wants what I want. And sometimes what I had wanted in a particular scenario was entirely uncommunicated; I guess I just figured my desires were strong & obvious enough to ooze out into the world to be recognized & pandered too.

Another thing I’ve learned is that I sometimes look for excuses to get offended within a relational interaction. I will search for reasons I can use to justify a poor attitude, choosing the worst possible interpretation of something spoken in order to legitimize my disconnection.

Pretty awesome behavioural pattern, I know.

Yet another discovery I’ve made is related to what I think is best referred to as “absolutism.” Now, I’ve known for a long time now that I have a strong tendency towards exactness & correctness, along with a foundational value for truth. However, what I’ve failed to notice until recently is that those attributes — which I maintain are, in general, good qualities to have — make me vulnerable to a hardcore absolutism that refuses to let grace into the picture. This ends up applying to both myself and others; if I happen to make a mistake in something I’ve said, I end up being far harsher of myself than is reasonable. In the same vein, if someone else says something that turns out to be incorrect, I can be merciless in my reaction to it.

In addition, I’ve come to recognize I can be quite critical at times, and taken a few small steps in understanding just how drastic my flavour of forgiveness differs from God’s.

In short, I’m really quite glad Jesus is very unlike me in some ways.

This whole journey of dysfunction discovery has been fascinating, illuminating, and, as you can imagine, painful, as Jesus shines His light into dirty corners of my world that had been dormant for so long I assumed they’d simply disappeared. I could spend more time diving into each one of these in greater depths, but, as valuable as these self-discoveries have been, I think the greater lessons I’ve learned have been in responding to those moments when I am confronted with my own shortcomings & failings.

What do I do when I realize I’m dysfunctional? What does it look like to respond well, to be a strong leader in my family, to hopefully exemplify healthy steps towards greater wholeness? What does it look like to intentionally create a safer environment for those around me, especially my wife & hopefully eventually some kids?

I have a few ideas.

It’s not brushing these issues off as “just the way I am.”

It’s not shoving them under the rug & pretending they don’t exist.

It’s not deflecting it by manipulating it to be a flaw in someone else instead, and blaming them for the negative interaction.

It’s not getting other people to figure out how to fix these issues in me.

It’s staring these failures in the face, fully understanding them, detailing them to myself and, in my case, to my wife, and communicating something to the effect of:

“This is a problem. It’s my problem. I’m sorry for how it’s impacted you. I’m not yet sure how to fix it, but I am fully committed to going on a journey with Jesus to figure it out. I refuse to stay dysfunctional in this way forever.”

And then it’s about following through by doing something along the lines of grabbing a Bible, sitting down with Jesus, letting Him speak abruptly & directly into that space, and then working to establish His thoughts into new behavioural patterns.

For example, when it comes to not getting my way, I read through 1 Corinthians 13 and come across: _“Love... does not insist on its own way.”_ It’s a simple verse, and quite a popular one, both in Christianity in general and in the context of marriage. And yet, it still has the potency to confront me with the dissonance between how I think and how God, who is love, thinks.

Or when I’m processing my quick offense to interactions, I find myself reading through verse after verse that contrasts with my behaviour:

_“Hatred keeps old quarrels alive, but love draws a veil over every insult and finds a way to make sin disappear.”_
-
Proverbs 10:12

_“If you shrug off an insult and refuse to take offense,_
_you demonstrate discretion indeed._
_But the fool has a short fuse_
_and will immediately let you know when he’s offended.”_
-
Proverbs 12:16

_“Love overlooks the mistakes of others,_
_but dwelling on the failures of others devastates friendships.”_
-
Proverbs 17:9

_“… love will be a canopy over a multitude of sins”_
-
1 Peter 4:8

… And I could go on. But the point is made, I think.

And then I ask God whether or not He feels I’m overly critical, sense a resounding “yes,” and then read verses like _“Judge not, that you be not judged”_ (Matthew 7:1) and _“if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses”_ (Matthew 5:15).

It’s obvious that there’s a conflict between how I behave and God’s ideal. I suppose one could attempt denying it all, and running away from truth in a desperate attempt to regain blissful ignorance, but I’m fairly confident that doesn’t work.

Instead, what I’ve been trying to do is give myself a bit of time, lean into Jesus, and humbly ask Him to do what no other person, program, process, or idea can do: change me from the inside out. Make me more like Him. Make me more like love.

And, in the process, hopefully give me new ways of being. New mindsets, new phrases & words, new sentences & responses to circumstances, new perspectives on things that let more compassion & grace into the picture. Oftentimes I will literally try a moment of failure over again in my mind, imaging how I would respond better or communicate more effectively if I was given a do-over, and pray that the simple practice might pave new pathways in my mind so that next time I am, hopefully, at least a little less broken.

And then it’s time to try out these new ideas, mindsets, and communication tools.

Sometimes, they work great, and I get to celebrate a win. Other times... Not so much. Other times they fall flat on their face in a crummy pile of miscommunication or unjustifiable offense on my part, and it’s time to follow Jesus back to the drawing board.

But regardless, I do think I’m growing. And I think I’m learning.

I’m learning that no disappointment or failed plan is worth compromising connection over.

I’m learning how to believe the best at all times, and interpret everything in the best possible light.

I’m learning to let more grace in to the incorrect words spoken by myself and others.

I’m learning that being critical never accomplished anything good.

I’m learning that if Jesus has never treated me a certain way, I can’t allow myself to treat others that way.

Ultimately though, while I treasure all these little bits & pieces of growth, my greater excitement is in my learning how to better dive into my own dysfunctions. While it’s never fun to discover some new broken aspect of your behaviour, I feel I have a bit more of a roadmap on how to process through it to reach greater wholeness, rather than just sulking in hopelessness, pretending it doesn’t exist, or trying to figure out a way to blame someone else.

That path looks like running towards my own internal brokenness, processing through it with Jesus & a Bible, and allowing Him to endue me with a new way of being that hopefully provides a place or greater safety for the people around me.

And that, my dear readers, is some of what Jesus has been teaching me lately.`,

    title: "I Miss Redding",
    body: `I Miss Redding.

I miss that strange intersection with a steep incline cutting back from East Street to Pine when you’re craving some good coffee & better chats at Evergreen.

For no particular reason, I miss that section of the Sacramento River Trail near the Arboretum where the raised trail runs along a parking lot.

I miss the start of highway 44 East out of downtown, sloping over the river and inviting you to take advantage of what feels like a premature 65 mph speed limit.

I miss Dana Drive & Minder Park.

I miss Norman Drive & Lema Ranch.

I miss Dogwood Lane... Kind of 😉

I miss setting up for worship sets, somehow a beautiful combination of skill, practical preparation, team connection, and Spiritual tuning up. I miss being trusted with the privilege of stewarding a room in musical worship, doing my best to utterly thrill a triune God while building a gateway between heaven & earth, attempting to somehow thin the perceived separation.

I miss those spontaneous drives to Whiskeytown that provided fairly epic vistas... But were sometimes more just excuses to talk.

I miss Sunday mornings at College View, stepping into the auditorium I used to only see on YouTube videos, and scanning the crowd for so many faces I’ve grown to love.

I miss Trader Joes & WinCo.

I miss Theory Coffee.

I miss in first year when my roommate would talk, almost with awe, about some wild man named Chuck Parry whose book he had read that had seen tons of incredible healings & miracles. And I miss Third Year when I got to be one of the six students to comprise Chuck’s team for the year.

I miss those early Saturday mornings, setting up for another couple hundred guests to the healing rooms, and praying that none would leave without a fresh encounter with Jesus.

I miss Chamise Peak & Shasta Dam.

I miss Dann Farrely and his “Nerd Excursions.” I miss Rich Schmidt routinely blowing my mind as he unpacked the Bible like I’d never experienced. I miss Bill Johnson, and those sermons that were less like 5-point, structured teaching sessions, and more like wanderings through his personal devotions that somehow left you stirred, provoked, and encouraged more deeply than any detailed note taking could capture. I miss Kris Vallotton, with his sometimes brutally honest way of communicating and hilarious vulnerability while sharing victorious lessons that were hard won.

I miss too many friends to list here, but you know who you are. I miss the games, the movies, the worship jam sessions, and the conversations. Oh, those conversations...

I miss that seemingly constant stream of talks with nearly everyone around me about revelations, encounters, challenges, dreams. But ultimately about one thing:

Jesus.

I deeply, truly, thoroughly miss Redding, California, and all it means to me.

Since leaving Redding, I find myself having random moments when a particular moment, person, or place in or around Redding will suddenly flash through my mind, reminding me yet again just how much that place became home. I think I underestimated exactly how attached I became to that city.

I’m still grappling with exactly what to do when those memories come flooding back. Mostly I just take a minute or two to thank God for the gift it was to spend three years of my life in Redding & at Bethel. I’m not really sure what else to to do.

I’m certainly not planning on moving back; that’s not what this post is about. It’s not even about a longing to go back. In many ways, going back geographically wouldn’t really accomplish that much. Sure, visiting Redding would bring about some great nostalgia, and getting to hang out at Bethel is always a delight. Plus, I do still have incredible friends living there that would be lovely to see again. I’m certain Kendra & I will venture down there sometime in the future.

But I can’t step back into those memories. They were moments, incredible ones, but not ones that could or even should be repeated. But these flashback moments have me musing.



Perhaps it’s just being back in Canada and Ontario for the first autumn in years, but this past fall season astounded me with brilliant colours like I can’t remember happening before — except for that one October in Algonquin Park — and it’s made me think a lot about seasons in general. In particular, the reaction to the changing: while most trees burst with orange, yellow, and red around the same time, there are always outliers.

Some, seemingly eager to be rid of the previous season, shed their leaves early, and stand stark & stale, ready to embrace winter while trees around them continue to glory in the brilliance of fall.

Others, on the other hand, seem to cling to summer, awkwardly hanging on to bunches of green leaves, as if in denial of the passing era.

Perhaps it’s a predictable cliche, but I still like the metaphor...

I want to be one that changes gracefully. I want to embrace each season fully.

I want to celebrate what has past or is passing with honour without trying to stretch it past its heavenly “best before” date, but I also don’t want to speed past a season that perhaps feels hidden, painful, or otherwise uncomfortable in a desperate attempt to get to some fantasy future of recognition & ease when God’s still revelling in the wonder of the here & now, with all its pruning and stretching and growing.

I miss BSSM. But I’m not going back.

I’m eager to see what God has in store for us in the future. But I refuse to let the future compromise my focus on the present.

Jesus, thank you for the here & now. Let the growth of the previous season flood me with gratitude, the promise of all that is to come pervade me with hope, and the beauty of the present fill me with wonder and attentiveness.

Let me move through every season with grace.`,
